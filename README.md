## Week 1
###### January 11, 2016

- This week, we were introduced to a new subject called **Discrete Mathematics** (DISMATH).
- We are here to examine problems logically and carry out precise mathematical reasoning by utilizing formal logic and set notation.
- I've learned that DISMATH deals ONLY with *mathematical truth*.
- I learned that a **proposition** is a declarative statement which can be either *true* (1) or *false* (0).
- A **proposition** cannot be both true and false.
- I also learned how to use **logical connectives** as the table shown below:

| **Logical Symbol**  |  **Logical Operator** | **Shorthand** | **Formula** | **Logical Expression** |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: | :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p) | ¬p |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q)) | p ∧ q |
| v | Disjunction | or | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q)) | p v q |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor | if val(p)  not equal val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0|  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
| → | Conditional | if, then | if val(p)  ≤ val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0  | p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |
